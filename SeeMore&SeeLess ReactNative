          This is a sample text that will be shown. This part is always visible.
          Here is the rest of the text that is hidden when the content is
          collapsed. This part is only visible when expanded. Here is some more
          text to ensure we have enough lines to test the see more and see less
          functionality. This should be a good test to see if our functionality
          works as expected. Adding a few more lines to make sure it looks good.
